Project Title - Shop or Drop

We created this project as part of my Module 1 requirement as a student at Flatiron School. The application is a hybrid between tinder and ebay. The idea is that users are able to "swipe" left or right on an item and decide if they either like the item, dislike the item, or buy the item right away. A user must also sign up and log in before using the application and can see their profile, user stats, and wishlist. We decided to have a little fun with the project and included some memes. 

Built With:

Ruby '2.3.3'
Rails '~> 5.2.1'

Notable Gems:
Bcrypt for password encryption 

How to Use? Simply fork and clone the project. Bundle install all the gems and start the server with rails s.
